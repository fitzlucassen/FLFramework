FLFramework is a french PHP Framework in development.
I don't want to be as stronger and complex than Zend or Symphony but I just want to learn how framework are implemented and take the best of each of them.

TODO

- Namespaces
- Databases prefix
- Payment API for helper implementation
- Cache for views
- Module manager
- Dispatcher refactoring
